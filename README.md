This is the source code for a website to count passing bicycles. You can use it here:

[https://busydoingnothing.co.uk/comptage](https://busydoingnothing.co.uk/comptage)

Currently the website is only in French.

The idea is that you answer a small set of multiple-choice questions for each passing bike and then click the “compter” button to add that bike to the counter. You can customise the questions with the edit button. It will note the answers you selected as well as the exact time the bike passed. Once the count is finished you can export the list as a spreadsheet in TSV format with the download icon at the top right.

Once the page is loaded the site doesn’t need internet access to work. All the data is stored locally on your device.
